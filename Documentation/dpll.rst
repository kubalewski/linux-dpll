The Linux kernel dpll subsystem
===============================


The main purpose of dpll subsystem is to provide general interface
to configure devices that use any kind of Digital PLL and could use
different sources of signal to synchronize to as well as different
types of outputs.
The main interface is NETLINK_GENERIC based protocol with an event
monitoring multicast group defined.


Device object
=============
Single dpll device object means single Digital PLL circuit and bunch of
pins connected with it.
It provides its supported working modes and current status to the user
in response to the `do` request of netlink command
``DPLL_CMD_DEVICE_GET`` and list of dplls registered in the subsystem
with `dump` netlink request of same command.
Requesting configuration of dpll device is done with `do` request of
netlink ``DPLL_CMD_DEVICE_SET`` command.


Pin object
==========
A pin is amorphic object which represents either source or output, it
could be internal component of the device, as well as externaly
connected.
The number of pins per dpll vary, but usually multiple pins shall be
provided for a single dpll device.
Pin's properties, capabilities and status is provided to the user in
response to `do` request of netlink ``DPLL_CMD_PIN_GET`` command.
It is also possible to list all the pins that were registered in the
system with `dump` request of ``DPLL_CMD_PIN_GET`` command.
Configuration of a pin can be changed by `do` request of netlink
``DPLL_CMD_PIN_SET`` command.


Pin selection
=============
In general selected pin (the one which signal is driving the dpll
device) can be obtained from ``DPLL_A_PIN_STATE`` attribute, and only
one pin shall be in ``DPLL_PIN_STATE_CONNECTED`` state for any dpll
device.

Pin selection can be done either manualy or automatically, depending on
hardware capabilities and active dpll device work mode
(``DPLL_A_MODE`` attribute). The consequence is that, there are
differences for each mode in terms of available pin states, as well
as for the states the user can request for a dpll device.

In manual mode (``DPLL_MODE_MANUAL``) the user can request or receive
one of following pin states:
- ``DPLL_PIN_STATE_CONNECTED`` - the pin is used to drive dpll device
- ``DPLL_PIN_STATE_DISCONNECTED`` - the pin is not used to drive dpll
  device

In automatic mode (``DPLL_MODE_AUTOMATIC``) the user can request or
receive one of following pin states:
- ``DPLL_PIN_STATE_SELECTABLE`` - the pin shall be considered as valid
  source for automatic selection algorithm
- ``DPLL_PIN_STATE_DISCONNECTED`` - the pin shall be not considered as
  a valid source for automatic selection algorithm
In automatic mode (``DPLL_MODE_AUTOMATIC``) the user can only receive
pin state ``DPLL_PIN_STATE_CONNECTED`` once automatic selection
algorithm locks a dpll device with one of the sources.


Shared pins
===========
A single pin object can be registered to multiple dpll devices.
Then there are two groups of configuration knobs:
1) Set on a pin - the configuration affects all dpll devices pin is
   registered to. (i.e. ``PIN_FREQUENCY``, ``PIN_DIRECTION``),
2) Set on a pin-dpll tuple - the configuration affects only selected
   dpll device. (i.e. PIN_PRIO, PIN_STATE).


MUX-type pins
=============
A pin can be MUX-type, it aggregates child pins and serves as a pin
multiplexer. One or more pins are registered with MUX-type instead of
being directly registered to a dpll device.
Pins registered with a MUX-type provide user with additional nested
attribute ``DPLL_A_PIN_PARENT`` for each parent they were registered
with.
If a pin was registered with multiple parent pins, they behave like a
multiple output multiplexer. In this case output of a
``DPLL_CMD_PIN_GET`` would contain multiple pin-parent nested
attributes with current state related to each parent, like:

``'pin': [{
        'device': [{'bus-name': 'pci',
                    'dev-name': '0000:21:00.0_0', 'id': 0}],
        'pin-direction': {'doc': 'pin used as a source of a signal',
                          'name': 'source'},
        'pin-idx': 13,
        'pin-parent': [{'pin-parent-idx': 2,
                        'pin-state': {'doc': 'pin disconnected',
                                      'name': 'disconnected'}},
                       {'pin-parent-idx': 3,
                        'pin-state': {'doc': 'pin disconnected',
                                      'name': 'disconnected'}}],
        }]``

Only one child pin can provide it's signal to the parent MUX-type pin at
a time, the selection is done with requesting change of child pin state
to ``DPLL_PIN_STATE_CONNECTED`` and providing a target MUX-type pin
index value in ``DPLL_A_PARENT_PIN_IDX``.

Pin priority
============
Some devices might offer a capability of automatic pin selection mode
(enum value ``DPLL_MODE_AUTOMATIC`` of ``DPLL_A_MODE`` attribute).
Usually such automatic selection is offloaded to the hardware,
which means only pins directly connected to the dpll are capable of
automatic source pin selection.
In automatic selection mode, the user cannot manually select a source
pin for the device, instead the user shall provide all directly
connected pins with a priority ``DPLL_A_PIN_PRIO``, the device would
pick a highest priority valid signal and connect with it.
Child pin of MUX-type is not capable of automatic source pin selection,
in order to configure a source of a MUX-type pin, the user needs to
request desired pin state of the child pin on the parent - it is done
with providing additional attribute for pin set state request - index
of parent pin he wish to propagate its signal to
(``DPLL_A_PARENT_PIN_IDX``).


Configuration commands group
============================

Configuration commands are used to get or dump information about
registered dpll devices (and pins), as well as set configuration of
device or pins. As dpll device could not be abstract and reflects real
hardware, there is no way to add new dpll device via netlink from user
space and each device should be registered by it's driver.

All netlink commands require ``GENL_ADMIN_PERM``. This is to prevent
any spamming/D.o.S. from unauthorized userspace applications.

List of netlink commands with possible attributes

suffix according to command purpose. All attributes use ``DPLL_A_``
prefix and suffix according to attribute purpose:

Netlink dump requests
=====================

The ``DEVICE_GET`` and ``PIN_GET`` commands are capable of dump type
netlink requests, in which case the response is in the same format as
for their ``do`` request.


SET commands format
===================

``DEVICE_SET`` - to target a dpll device, the user provides either a
``ID`` or both ``BUS_NAME`` and ``DEV_NAME``, as well as parameter being
configured (``DPLL_A_MODE``).

``PIN_SET`` - to target a pin user has to provide a ``PIN_IDX``, but
pin does not exist on its own, thus a dpll device must be also targeted
with either a ``ID`` or both ``BUS_NAME`` and ``DEV_NAME`` to which
pin being configured was registered with. Also configured pin parameters
must be added.
If ``PIN_DIRECTION`` or ``PIN_FREQUENCY`` are configured, this affects
all the dpll device they are connected.
If ``PIN_PRIO`` or ``PIN_STATE`` are configured, this affects only
the dpll device being targeted.
If valid ``PIN_PARENT_IDX`` is provided, the set command shall affect
the configuration between a pin and it's parent, which is a
``PIN_STATE``.
In general it is possible to configure multiple parameters at once.

Notifications
=============

dpll device can provide notifications regarding status changes of the
device, i.e. lock status changes, source/output type changes or alarms.
This is the multicast group that is used to notify user-space apps via
netlink socket: ``DPLL_MCGRP_MONITOR``

Notifications messages (attrbiutes use ``DPLL_A`` prefix):

  ========================= ==========================================
  ``EVENT_DEVICE_CREATE``   event value new dpll device was created
    ``ID``                  attr internal dpll device ID
    ``DEV_NAME``            attr dpll device name
    ``BUS_NAME``            attr dpll device bus name
  ``EVENT_DEVICE_DELETE``   event value dpll device was deleted
    ``ID``                  attr dpll device index
  ``EVENT_DEVICE_CHANGE``   event value dpll device attribute has
                            changed
    ``ID``                  attr modified dpll device ID
    ``PIN_IDX``             attr the modified pin index

Device change event shall consiste of the attribute and the value that
has changed.


Device driver implementation
============================

Device is allocated by ``dpll_device_get`` call. Second call with the
same arguments doesn't create new object but provides pointer to
previously created device for given arguments, it also increase refcount
of that object.
Device is deallocated by ``dpll_device_put`` call, which first decreases
the refcount, once refcount is cleared the object is destroyed.

Device should implement set of operations and register device via
``dpll_device_register`` at which point it becomes available to the
users. Only one driver instance can register a dpll device within dpll
subsytem. Multiple driver instances can obtain reference to it with
``dpll_device_get``.

The pins are allocated separately with ``dpll_pin_get``, it works
similarly to ``dpll_device_get``. Creates object and the for each call
with the same arguments the object refcount increases.

Once dpll device is created, allocated pin can be registered with it
with 2 different methods, always providing implemented pin callbacks,
and private data pointer for calling them:
``dpll_pin_register`` - simple registration with a dpll device.
``dpll_pin_on_pin_register`` - register pin with another MUX type pin.

For different instances of a device driver requiring to find already
registered dpll (i.e. to connect its pins to it) use ``dpll_device_get``
to obtain proper dpll device pointer.

The name of dpll device is generated based on registerer provided module
struct pointer, clock_id and device_idx values.
Name is in format: ``%s/%llx/%d`` where arguments are as follows:
``module_name(dpll->module)`` - syscall on parent module struct pointer
``dpll->clock_id``            - registerer given clock id
``dpll->device_idx``          - registerer given device id

Notifications of adding or removing dpll devices are created within
subsystem itself.
Notifications about registering/deregistering pins are also invoked by
the subsystem.
Notifications about status changes either of dpll device or a pin shall
be requested by device driver with ``dpll_device_notify`` or
``dpll_pin_notify``.

The device driver using dpll interface is not required to implement all
the callback operation. Nevertheless there are few required to be
implemented.
Required dpll device level callback operations:
- ``.mode_get``
- ``.lock_status_get``

Required pin level callback operations:
- ``.state_get``
- ``.direction_get``

There is no strict requirement to implement all the operations for
each device, every operation handler is checked for existence and
ENOTSUPP is returned in case of absence of specific handler.
